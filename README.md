# Check-if-two-PDF-documents-are-identical-with-Python
To check whether two PDF files are identical, we can use file hashing. A hash function generates a unique fixed-size string (hash value) for given data. If two files are exactly the same, their hashes will also be the same.  In Python, the hashlib module provides different hash algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 etc.
